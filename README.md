The goal of this application is to provide businesses with an easy to use web application where management can provide business reports for executives and online training material for their employees.

Click here for the [live demo](https://rbsdocsfrontend.vercel.app). (The application will take a few seconds to start from sleep, as the back end is hosted on the free heroku plan.)

The repository for the back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/Earth-Hominid/docs-backend).

## Description

This fullstack application is demo of an application that was built to allow small businesses to create educational material, reports and to share sensitive information among the mangement team.

The application was built with authentication in order to  provide several levels of authorization layers for users. 

### Frontend

The front-end is written in TypeScript and built with the NextJS framework.

NextJS allows the JSON Webtoken to be stored server side, which is a great feature and negates the typical sercurity risks when the Webtoken is stored client side.

### Backend

The backend is written in JavaScript and built with the Strapi framework.
