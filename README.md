The goal of this application is to provide businesses with an easy to use web application where management can provide business reports for executives and online training material for their employees.

## Description

This fullstack application is demo of an application that was built to allow small businesses to report and share sensitive information amongs their mangement teams and to provide online training material for their employees.

The application contains a layer of both authentication and authorization, thus, only users who are intended to access the materials have access.

### Frontend

The front-end is written in TypeScript and built with the NextJS framework.

NextJS allows the JSON Webtoken to be stored server side, which is a great feature and negates the typical sercurity risks when the Webtoken is stored client side.

### Backend

The backend is written in JavaScript and built with the Strapi framework.
